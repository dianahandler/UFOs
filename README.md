# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this week's module challenge was to combine aspects of javascript and html to create a website that allowed us to filter UFO data with javascript-generated tabular data.

## Results
There are five criteria that the user can use to search: date, city, state, country, and shape. The search bars contain examples of each criteria upon opening the website as shown below. One must only press enter after typing in their preferences for the filter to be applied

## Summary
A drawback of this layout is that the data given is quite limited. While it does perform the rudimentary function of filtration, it could benefit by adding graphing abilities. Some recommendations for future development would be to incorporate javascript charting so that the user could compare how many sightings of UFOs were recorded by state and year. It could also be helpful to allow additional information to each recorded data entry such as a link to the initial sighting report.
